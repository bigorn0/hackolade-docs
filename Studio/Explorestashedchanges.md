# Explore stashed changes

## Coming soon

When you open a local repository and choose Explore repository \> Stashes in the left menu, you get a table listing all the uncommitted changes you might have stashed for later reuse.

&nbsp;

Each stash can be reviewed, applied back to uncommitted changes, or dropped.

When applying changes, you may have to resolve conflicts if any are detected by the system.
