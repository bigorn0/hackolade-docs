# Welcome to Hackolade Studio

Hackolade is an intuitive yet powerful application to perform the visually data modeling of many NoSQL and multi-model databases (in order of appearance...):

\*: To Be Added

&nbsp;

Hackolade combines the graphical representation of collections in an Entity Relationship Diagram, with the graphical representation of the JSON Schema definition of each collection in a hierarchical schema View.&nbsp; Together, these graphical representations provide the schema model of a NoSQL application, and the documentation of that model.&nbsp; The application is specifically designed around the powerful nature of JSON nested sub-objects and denormalization.

&nbsp;

The software facilitates the work of, and the dialog between analysts, architects, designers, developers, testers, DBAs, and operators of systems that are based on such technologies.&nbsp; It also can generate schema scripts and documentation in a variety of machine-based (e.g.; JSON Schema, MongoDB Validator, Mongoose, DynamoDB CreateTable and ConditionExpression scripts...), Couchbase Ottoman, or human-readable formats such as HTML and PDF reports.

&nbsp;

Instead of having to find data structures tacitly described in the application code, the creation of a database model helps to evaluate design options beforehand, think through the implications of different alternatives, and recognize potential hurdles before committing sizable amounts of development effort.&nbsp; A database model helps plan ahead, in order to minimize later rework.&nbsp; In the end, the modeling process accelerates development, increases quality of the application, and reduces execution risks.

&nbsp;

You will hopefully find Hackolade user-friendly.&nbsp; In case it is is not sufficiently intuitive, this help documentation is designed so you can quickly learn Hackolade as a new user, or enhance your knowledge as a regular user.
