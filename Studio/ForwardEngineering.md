# Forward-Engineering

The forward-engineering function is used to export models or parts of models.&nbsp; It is also used to generate schema artifacts in the language of each specific physical target: DDLs for RDBMS, and schema scripts for other targets. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

In a use case of starting a model from scratch, Hackolade Studio helps developers' productivity by providing a variety of forward-engineering options:

&nbsp;

* a JSON or YAML sample document
* a JSON Schema or YAML Schema
* an Excel file&nbsp;
* target-specific script

&nbsp;

The isActivated property exists for all objects (containers, entities, and attributes), and is ON by default.&nbsp; If unchecked, it allows to comment (for targets that allow commenting in scripts) or to filter objects in forward-engineering.
