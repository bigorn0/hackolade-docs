# Forward-Engineering

The forward-engineering function is used to export models or parts of models.

&nbsp;

In a use case of starting a model from scratch, Hackolade helps developer's productivity by providing a variety of forward-engineering options found in the menu on the left.

&nbsp;

The isActivated property exists for all objects (containers, entities, and attributes), and is ON by default.&nbsp; If unchecked, it allows to comment (for targets that allow commenting in scripts) or to filter objects in forward-engineering.
