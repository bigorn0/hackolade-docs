# Download additional target plugins

## Download and enable plugin

To enable the custom properties capability, you first need to download a plugin for each database target for which you wish to add properties.&nbsp; To do so, go to Help \>&nbsp; Plugin Manager

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may choose which plugin to install on your computer.

&nbsp;

This will result in the plugin appearing in the Installed tab of the plugin manager.

## Are you experiencing issues with plugin download?

Do you have your network proxy set correctly?&nbsp; See more details [here](<Networkproxy.md>).

&nbsp;

There is an alternative: you may download the plugin from [our GitHub repo](<https://github.com/hackolade> "target=\"\_blank\""), then go to the plugin of your choice, and click on Clone or download then Download ZIP.

Then to install, go to Help \> Plugin Manager and click the button Install from Zip.

## Plugin Manager options for an installed plugin

In the Installed tab of the Plugin Manager, you may see multiple buttons:

&nbsp;

**Remove:** this button deletes the plugin from your machine

**Disable:** this button keeps the plugin on your machine but turns it OFF, so it no longer appears in the targets available to create models.

**Migrate:**  this has to do with customizations you may have made to this plugin.  The whole thing is documented in [this page](<Migrationtoenhancedcustompropert.md>). If you don't have customizations dating prior to v3.6.2, you may probably ignore.  But it is safer to first migrate just in case, then update to the latest version of the plugin.
