# Studio how-to guides docs

Product documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, conceptual

Following methodology described [here]([Introduction &mdash; Documentation system documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/)).  And this example of GatsbyJS [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) and corresponding [repo]([gatsby/docs at master · gatsbyjs/gatsby · GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/docs)).

## Read docs at https://hackolade.com/help

We intend the docs to be read on [hackolade.com](https://hackolade.com/help) — You can read them here of course :-) Just be warned that links won't always work and other things will be missing or less than optimal.

Go forth and build cool stuff.
