If you have data models in erwin and want to leverage them in Hackolade, you need to fist export them to XSD, following the instructions below.&nbsp; You should first consult [this page](<XSDoflogicalmodels.md>) for an overview of the import functionality in Hackolade.

&nbsp;

By default ERwin does not export primary key and foreign key constraints. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

It is suggested to use the parameters below when exporting models to XSD,&nbsp;
