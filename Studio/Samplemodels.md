# Sample models

By looking at existing models, you'll quickly see how to leverage the power of Hackolade, and learn from the examples.&nbsp; We suggest you download these examples and place them into a schema directory such as %userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\models. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may take this opportunity to declare your default paths in Tools \> Options, for example:

%userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\models

%userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\forward-engineering

%userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\reverse-engineering

%userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\SSL

%userprofile%\\Documents\\Hackolade\\documentation

&nbsp;

Sample models can be found on this [page](<http://hackolade.com/samplemodels.html> "target=\"\_blank\"").
