# Containers in ER diagram

With version 1.4.0, Hackolade has introduced support for multiple model containers, depending on the target:

\- multiple databases in MongoDB

\- multiple regions in DynamoDB

\- multiple buckets in Couchbase

\- multiple groups in JSON

\- etc...

&nbsp;

If necessary for your application, you can define multiple groups in the same model, possibly with inter-group relationships
