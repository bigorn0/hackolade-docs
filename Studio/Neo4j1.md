# Neo4j Cypher

As you develop the model for your Neo4j graph database, with node labels and relationship types with constraints and indexes, Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding Cypher script.

&nbsp;

The information can be viewed in the Cypher Script tab:

You may export these scripts to a Cypher file with the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Cypher Script:
