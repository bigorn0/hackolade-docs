# Quick start guide

The main use cases for the creation of a new model in Hackolade:

* you want to create a model for a new application and database that do not yet exist.&nbsp; You need to start a model from [scratch](<Createanewmodelfromscratch.md>) then [forward-engineer](<ForwardEngineering.md>)
* you want to create then enrich the documentation of an existing database, and make it evolve.&nbsp; You want to leverage the [reverse-engineering](<Reverseengineeranexistinginstanc.md>) capabilities built in Hackolade.&nbsp;
* you want to [migrate](<SQLDDL.md>) from a relational database to a denormalized NoSQL model. &nbsp;
