[JSON](<http://www.json.org/> "target=\"\_blank\"") (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.&nbsp; It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language.&nbsp; JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages.&nbsp; These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.&nbsp; JSON is built on two structures:

* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
