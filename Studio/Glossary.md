| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Collection | In MongoDB this is the equivalent of RDBMS tables.&nbsp; A Collection stores data in the form of JSON documents.&nbsp; Other NoSQL document databases may call them 'Tables' still&nbsp; And others call them 'Buckets'. |
| Database | A set of Collections/Tables/Buckets |
| Documentation | One of the outputs of the application.&nbsp; In HTML, Markdown, or PDFformat.&nbsp; It is dynamically generated by the application. |
| Entity Relationship diagram | The visual representation of the Collections and the possible Relationships between their fields. |
| Fields | Attributes of a Collection document.&nbsp; These are simple attribute, as compared to Objects. |
| Hierarchical schema view | Hierarchical representation of a JSON document schema. |
| JSON Schema | JSON document describing the characteristics and constraints of another JSON document.&nbsp; Similar to how an XSD schema describes an XML document.&nbsp; More information regarding this standard can be found on [http://json-schema.org](<http://json-schema.org> "target=\"\_blank\"") |
| Model | The atomic entity gathering all the concepts described herein and their related information.&nbsp; The data about the model can be stored, retrieved, edited, documented.&nbsp; |
| Objects | Complex attributes such as arrays and sub-documents. |
| Properties | Detailed information about an entity: Database, Collections, Fields and Objects, and Relationships. &nbsp; |
| Relationship | This information is not explicitly declared in a NoSQL document database or application API.&nbsp; The capability is however provided here to enrich the documentation and general comprehension of the model.&nbsp; It describes the logical links between Fields of different Collections and their cardinality |
| Sample | Data example that are used to illustrate how a Field can be used. |
| Schema | The structure of Collections, as defined in JSON Schema and extensions.&nbsp; It is an output of the application, to be used along with a validator to insure compliance of documents being submitted to storage in MongoDB Collections. |
| Scripts | Another output of the application.&nbsp; Starting with the upcoming version 3.2 of MongoDB, it is allowed to create validation rules associated with each Collection. |
