# HBase

Given the limited capabilities of HBase in terms of forward-engineering, the script is very basic, i.e. limited to the creation of the table and column family.

The script can also be exported to the file system via the menu Tools \> Forward-Engineering, or via the [Command-Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).
