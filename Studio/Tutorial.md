# Tutorial

We try real hard to make Hackolade Studio as intuitive as possible with a minimalist design, and we avoid to bloat the software with functionality that few people ever use.&nbsp; In reality, the use cases for the tool are quite simple:

* start from a blank page, construct your data structures, then forward-engineer artifacts to be consumed by target technologies or data citizens;
* or reverse-engineer an existing instance, enrich the model with descriptions and constraints, then publish the documentation

&nbsp;

The complexity appears when diving deeper in each of the use cases.&nbsp; NoSQL and JSON seem simple from the outside, but their power and flexibility offer many permutations that end up increasing complexity.&nbsp; With Hackolade Studio, we try to deal with this complexity in simpler ways, and only when necessary.

&nbsp;

As a result, you don't need extensive training to create a simple data model.&nbsp; But to be a power user, you need to be aware of all the bells and whistles provided to handle real-life situations.

&nbsp;

People learn in different ways:

* [dive in the application](<https://hackolade.com/download.html> "target=\"\_blank\"") and explore;
* start by reading user manuals such as this [online help](<https://hackolade.com/help/index.html>);
* read step-by-step instructions on an ad-hoc basis;
* watch [short videos](<https://hackolade.com/videos.html> "target=\"\_blank\"");
* receive a personal and [interactive training session](<https://calendly.com/pdesmarets> "target=\"\_blank\"");
* [open a ticket](<https://hackolade.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new> "target=\"\_blank\"") to ask a question.

&nbsp;

We try to accommodate whatever method works for our users.

&nbsp;

Some people like the linear flow of outlines, while others prefer non-linear mindmapping.&nbsp; In addition to the tutorial pages below, we have started an experimental mindmap on this Miro [page](<https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_kmBxYFg=/> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; There are 2 views: a functional view, and a user interface view.&nbsp; In the boxes of each view, you can click on the hyperlink to a page of this online documentation.
