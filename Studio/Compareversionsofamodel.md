# Compare versions of a model

**Note:** for users with the Professional edition of Hackolade, a much more powerful comparison is available via the [Command Line Interface](<CommandLineInterface.md>).

&nbsp;

As Hackolade persists models in text files, it is easy to do a basic comparison of different versions of a model, 2 at a time, as long as both have been saved on disk.

If you want to swap the 2 models, simply click on the arrows:![Image](<lib/Model%20compare%20--%20swap%20left-right.png>)

&nbsp;

By default, you get a side-by-side view of the differences.

Using the scroll bar (or mouse wheel), you can review the changes, with the 2 windows scrolling in sync.

&nbsp;

If you prefer an in-line view of the differences, you can toggle using the button at the bottom left of the window:

&nbsp;

Hackolade does not currently allow you to merge the changes.&nbsp; They would have to be manually created with the application standard functionalities.
