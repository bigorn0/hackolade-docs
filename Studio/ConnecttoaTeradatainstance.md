# Connect to a Teradata instance

**Important:** when reverse-engineering or forward-engineering a Teradata instance, the (Teradata) user used to connect to the target instance should have access to read **SYSUDTLIB** system database to retrieve DDL scripts for UDT, UDM etc...

More information is available [here](<https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Teradata-VantageTM-SQL-Data-Definition-Language-Syntax-and-Examples-17.20/Table-Statements/CREATE-TABLE-and-CREATE-TABLE-AS> "target=\"\_blank\"").

**Important:** when reverse-engineering or forward-engineering a Teradata instance, Hackolade is leveraging the Teradata **Java** client.  You will need a working and properly configured Java environment (minimum Java 11).  Hackolade tries to autodetect **JAVA_HOME** on your system but you can still configure it manually if your installation is specific (or if our automatic detection canâ€™t find **JAVA_HOME**) in **Tool > Options**.

You can configure the Java path in **Tools > Options > Reverse Engineering > Java path** section.

&nbsp;

The Teradata instance can be hosted on-premises, or on virtualized machines in a private or public cloud. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the Hackolade connection settings dialog, give a meaningful name to the connection, then set the the host and port if you wish to limit the scope of the discovery.
