# OpenAPI file

As you develop the model for OpenAPI with metadata, requests, responses, components, parameters, schemas, extensions, etc... Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding OpenAPI documentation file, in JSON or YAML, following strictly the [OpenAPI specification](<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md> "target=\"\_blank\"").

An internal OpenAPI syntax validator ensures that the generated file is valid, and the right-hand pane allows interactions with the API and testing.&nbsp;
