# From ER/Studio

If you have data models in ER/Studio and want to leverage them in Hackolade, you need to fist export them to XSD, following the instructions below.&nbsp; You should first consult [this page](<XSDoflogicalmodels.md>) for an overview of the import functionality in Hackolade.

&nbsp;

By default ERwin does not export primary key and foreign key constraints. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

For ER/Studio, the suggested parameters in the wizard are as follows:

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 1](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%201.png>)

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 2](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%202.png>)

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 3 model](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%203%20model.png>)

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 3 dictionary](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%203%20dictionary.png>)

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 3 general](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%203%20general.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 3 datatype](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%203%20datatype.png>)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

![ER-Studio Wizard - page 3 name conversion](<lib/ER-Studio%20Wizard%20-%20page%203%20name%20conversion.png>)

&nbsp;

Knowing that the export function does not work with all version of ER/Studio, another option is to use the MetaWizard export in XSD format:
