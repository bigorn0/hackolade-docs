# Getting started

The installation of Hackolade does not require 'admin rights' for the PC.&nbsp; But it does require that you have Write rights for the directory where Hackolade is installed, e.g. C:\\Hackolade&nbsp; Nevertheless, if you encounter a Windows "error 5 access denied", you may want to take a look at this [article](<https://appuals.com/fix-error-5-access-denied-windows-10/> "target=\"\_blank\"").
