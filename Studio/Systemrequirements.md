# System requirements

Hackolade's recommended systems configuration is any of the following platforms:

* **Windows:** Windows 10 Core 2 Duo or better with 4GB+ RAM, 64-bit only (Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2 may work but is not longer guaranteed)
* **Mac:** OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher, 64-bit only.
* **Linux:** 64-bit only Ubuntu 12.04 or higher.&nbsp; Fedora 21 and Debian 8 might work as well, but have not been verified.&nbsp; CentOS without GUI will NOT work.

&nbsp;
