For those in a technology stack using JavaScript, and are using the [Mongoose ODM](<http://mongoosejs.com/> "target=\"\_blank\""), Hackolade also provides the option to export a JavaScript Mongoose schema file for the collection definition via the menu option Tools \> Forward-Engineering \> Mongoose Schema:

As you export Mongoose schema, you have several choices:

\- which collections are exported

\- whether you want object notation (to support definitions) or JSON

\- whether to export the schema as one single file or one file per collection
