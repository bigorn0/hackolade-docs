### How to work with Git submodules?

Git submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project while keeping your commits separate.

&nbsp;

The presence of Git submodules in a repository will not prevent you from using Hackolade Studio. But there is no handling of Git submodules currently in Hackolade Studio.

### How to deal with non-ASCII symbols in file names?

By default, Git replaces non-ASCII symbols in file names with octal notation. For example, a file named "TrainSchedule—Ñ.json" will be treated by Git as "TrainSchedule\\321\\204.json".

If you need to deal with non-ASCII symbols in file names, then open a terminal and run the command below in order to modify the default behavior of your local Git client.
