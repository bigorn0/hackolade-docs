# Swagger file

As you develop the model for Swagger API with metadata, requests, responses, definitions, parameters, schemas, extensions, etc... Hackolade dynamically generates the corresponding Swagger documentation file, in JSON or YAML, following strictly the [Swagger specification](<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md> "target=\"\_blank\"").

An internal Swagger syntax validator ensures that the generated file is valid, and the right-hand pane allows interactions with the API and testing.&nbsp;
