# Explore all files

When you open a local repository and click on Explore repository \> All files in the left menu, you get a table listing all files belonging to the repository.

You can create a new data model by clicking on the button at the top-right corner of the pane (or by pressing Ctrl+N / Cmd+N.)&nbsp; If you save a newly created data model while having a repository opened, then Hackolade suggests to save it in that repository by default.&nbsp; This behavior takes precedence over the default folder defined in "Tools \> Options \> Default Paths \> Models".

&nbsp;

Any change made outside Hackolade should be automatically reflected in the table (e.g. creating a file, modifying a file, deleting a file.)&nbsp; If you believe that the content of the table does not properly reflect the state of your filesystem, you can click on the refresh icon next to the title.

&nbsp;

Note that, if Git has been instructed to ignore some files (through the [gitignore](<https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore> "target=\"\_blank\"") functionality), they are not listed in the table.
