# Object browser pane

The left-hand pane shows a dynamic tree representing the hierarchy of objects maintained in your current model.&nbsp; The tree is collapsible, but expanded by default.&nbsp; For large models, it can be quite long.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may adjust the width of the pane by moving the vertical ellipse ![Central pane - ellipse hovered](<lib/Central%20pane%20-%20ellipse%20hovered.png>)separating the Object Browser and central panes.&nbsp; You may toggle the appearance of the Object Browser pane by choosing the menu option View \> Object Browser, or by double-clicking on the vertical ellipse.

&nbsp;

To collapse a tree branch, click on ![Object browser - Minus](<lib/Object%20browser%20-%20Minus.png>).&nbsp; To expand a tree branch, click on ![Object browser - Plus](<lib/Object%20browser%20-%20Plus.png>).

&nbsp;

It is possible to toggle the appearance of the Object Browser pane from the workspace by choosing the menu View \> Object Browser.Pane.

&nbsp;

A **single-click** on an object increases the ERD zoom on the selected object, and displays the corresponding properties in the Properties Pane.

&nbsp;

A **double-click** on an object opens the hierarchical schema view and zooms in on the selected object.

&nbsp;

A **right-click** displays a contextual menu of actions possible for the selected object.

![Find - replace all matched](<lib/Find%20-%20replace%20all%20matched.png>) replace all matched words

&nbsp;
